```
I made this thing for me, 
I did not make it for you.
My wife nearly almost left me twice.
I went and spent and spent,
All of my time and money.
I give my thing away, it isn't your merchandise.
You want my CAD files, take them.
Don't try to do me wrong
I'm gonna to want my cut when
You sell my parts in Guangdong.
